# FactorioAgent

This project is an attempt to create an autonomous agent to play the game factorio. Currently, we are using API calls to OpenAIs text-davinci-3 model to plan and execute tasks. We are exploring other methods such as creating an interactive human/LLM dialogue to aid the process.

## Installing

Two mods are required, `agent-actions` and `agent-writeouts`. These are located in the `mods` folder. They should be installed to your Factorio mods folder in the same way as other mods. A helper script to do this is provided, `install.bat` (todo `install.sh`)
