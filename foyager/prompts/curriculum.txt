Answer: ...


You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a mentor and guide me to the next task based on my current tech level and production targets.
2) Please be very specific about what resources I need to collect, what I need to craft, what needs built, what needs transported.
3) The next task should follow a concise format, such as Move [x] [y] "Craft [quantity] [entity]", "Place Blueprint [name] [x] [y]". It should be a single phrase. Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should not be too hard since I may not have the necessary resources or involve too many steps
5) The next task should be expanding the factory. I should look for new recipes to craft, Upgrade my factory to use new tech, and discover new tech. I should be automating as much as possible to the biggest scale possible
6) I may sometimes need to repeat some tasks if I need to collect more resources to complete more difficult tasks. Only repeat tasks if necessary.

You should only respond in the format as described below:
RESPONSE FORMAT:
Reasoning: Based on the information I listed above, do reasoning about what the next task should be.
Task: The next task.

Reasoning: The player only has one burner-drill. It needs more iron plates.
